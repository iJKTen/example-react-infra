# React SPA Infrastructure

CloudFormation template that deploys a React single-page application to AWS with S3 hosting, CloudFront CDN, CI/CD pipeline, Route 53 DNS, security headers, and client-side routing support.

## Prerequisites

- **Connection stack** deployed exporting `Example-GitHubConnectionArn` (series post 2)
- **Certificate stack** deployed in `us-east-1` exporting `Example-CertificateArn` (series post 3)
- **Git Sync role** with all permissions from series posts 4 through 12

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `ProjectName` | Prefix used for naming all resources (e.g. `Example`) |
| `DomainName` | Fully qualified domain name (e.g. `app.example.net`) |
| `GitHubRepository` | GitHub repository in `owner/repo` format |
| `GitHubBranch` | Branch to track for CI/CD pipeline (default: `main`) |
| `HostedZoneId` | Route 53 hosted zone ID for the domain |
| `BuildOutputDirectory` | Build output directory for the SPA framework (default: `dist`) |

## What Gets Created

- S3 bucket for site files (private, versioned, 7-day noncurrent cleanup)
- CloudFront distribution with OAC, HTTP/2+3, TLS 1.2, Brotli compression, and SPA error handling
- Custom error responses rewriting 403/404 to `/index.html` with 200 status for client-side routing
- S3 bucket policy scoped to the specific CloudFront distribution
- Route 53 A-record alias pointing the domain to CloudFront
- S3 artifact bucket for pipeline intermediates
- CodePipeline with Source, Build, and Deploy stages
- CodeBuild build project (Node.js 20, `npm run build`, `VITE_API_URL` env var)
- CodeBuild deploy project with two-tier S3 caching and CloudFront invalidation
- IAM roles for CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and the deploy project
- CloudFront response headers policy (HSTS, CSP with `connect-src` for API, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)

## Deploy

The repo includes two files. `infra.yaml` is the CloudFormation template. `deployment-file.yaml` is the deployment file that Sync from Git reads to find the template and resolve parameter values.

1. Update the placeholder values in `deployment-file.yaml` with your domain, repository, hosted zone ID, API domain, and API URL.
2. Push the repo to GitHub.
3. Follow the Sync from Git process in series post 15 to create the stack.

## Architecture

Uses two-tier caching. Hashed assets (JS, CSS, images) get `max-age=31536000,public,immutable` because new builds produce new filenames. The single `index.html` gets `max-age=0,no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate` so browsers always fetch the latest version. CloudFront custom error responses serve `index.html` with a 200 status for any path, allowing React Router to handle client-side routing.
